Running the application: Run the application. The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Application logic: The application has three endpoints: /weather, /forecast, and /atmospheric-pressure.

The /weather endpoint accepts two query parameters: lat and lon, which represent the latitude and longitude of the location for which the current weather is required. The endpoint returns a JSON object with the current temperature and weather description for the specified location.

The /forecast endpoint accepts three query parameters: city, country, and days, which represent the city and country for which the weather forecast is required, and the number of days for which the forecast is required, respectively.

The /atmospheric-pressure endpoint accepts two query parameters: city and country, which represent the city and country for which the atmospheric pressure is required. The endpoint returns a JSON object with the current atmospheric pressure for the specified city.

All endpoints use the OpenWeatherMap API to obtain weather data. The API key is stored in the code as a string constant, but should be stored securely in a configuration file or environment variable.
